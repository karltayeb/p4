Part A:

We chose to first make GVertex and WEdge with comparable generics. 
We did this because we felt it would require less transition to have these and simply implement WGraphP4 with these 
(since they would now be weighted, generic, and comparable) rather than going through all the trouble of making WGraphP4 
extending the WGraph interface and then switching over to make the Edges and Vertices as they were supposed to be.

GVertex and WEdge were initially extended by Karl, but all three group members contributed to implementing their methods.

To make WGraphP4 we wrote it method by method from the interface and quickly finished all the easy methods, 
making the changes necessary to make it work with the interface, WEdge, and GVertex.  We then spent much more time 
completing the harder methods such as Kruskals and Depth-first. Most of this work was done in group programming sessions.

Our depth first method is implemented with a queue, rather than recursively, as discussed in class.

Our approach with the adjacency list was to make an array list of array lists of edges. We chose to store edges because 
they contain all the information necessary, rather than edges and vertices because that would be redundant (edges store
references to the pertinent vertices). Note that our adjacency list is structured such that you can index into the list
of edges for a given vertex by indexing at the vertex id. We do this so that WGraphP4 should support non-sequential insertion
of vertices (although this isn't really necessary for part c, we figured it was expected of a general graph implementation).

Part B:

Richard wrote our implementation of Kruskals algorithm. Natasha and Richard wrote the tests for Kruskal's algorithm.
Our implementation of Kruskal's is motivated by the DSA textbook, we use the Partition class provided.

Karl did most of the work for creating the general PQHeap since he had written a max heap for the MaxPQHeap 
test file assignment earlier. He also adapted, corrected and updated his test file which is included in this 
submission as PQHeapTest.java. One of the big challenges was dealing with rounding errors in the indexing calculations. 
We ended up adding a small 1e-10 value to calculations when doing floor functions to avoid truncating. 
In testing we found this sufficient for fairly large values.

Part C:

Karl worked with Natasha to make Pixel.java and making a graph representation of the image.
We include accesor methods for getting the r g b values.

In a group setting we figured out our approach to implementing the modified kruskal's, 
although Richard was mainly in the drivers seat for coding. Karl and Natasha helped debug and improve efficiency.

Karl wrote the code in main() of P4C. At first the program ran extremely slowly but eventually produced well segmented images. 
To resolve this slow runtime we went back through our earlier methods and made better data-structures choices. 
In a group setting we combed through our code and found where we could improve on efficiency.

In particular, we found HashSets be particular useful in cases were we needed to search for vertices or edges. 
For example, allEdges() in WGraphP4 returns a list but it had to check to make sure duplicated edges weren't 
being added to the list (since our adjacency list adds an edge to both the source and end members adjacency lists). 
By adding edges to a Hashset and then making a list from the set we were able to drastically able improve run time.

It is worth noting, that in order to get good runtime we also added a few additional methods to WGraphP4.
The two methods we added that are not in the interface are getVertex(int id) and clearEdges().
getVertex(int id) goes is an accessor to get the vertex in a graph. Vertices are stored in a HashMap called verts
for quick lookup. verts maps vertex IDs to the vertices. This is suitable since each vertex in a graph has a unique ID.
We add getVertex because otherwise we would have to call allVertices and then access the vertex we want. The problem with
this would have been that allVetices returns a list but verts is a HashMap. It's O(N) to get the list from the hashset
and trying to access vertices this way made the program run forever. With getVertex we cut runtime for the largest images
down to under a minute.

Additionally we found it much faster to remove all the edges from the list and add back the edges found by segmenter() 
than it was to search for and remove the edges not returned by segmenter(). By doing this, we could then use a 
Depth-first search at a given vertex to get all the vertices in a segment. This is the general approach we used for 
getting the pixels of a segment and saving them to images. In order to do this easily we added clearEdges() which simply
removes all the edges in the graph.

In segmenter(), the modified Kruskals method, we have a HashMap<Integer, int[]> where we store the min/max values of a segment
while we build the spanning forest.  This is so we don't have to go through an entire tree to find the min/max RGB values every time 
we check to add an edge to the forest or not.  The Key is an Integer and is the root of the tree in consideration.  The Value is an int[]
of length 7 that has the following data values in order from index 0-6: minRed, minBlue, minG, maxRed, maxBlue, maxGreen, treeSize.
All the helper methods of the modified Kruskals method, including partialUnion() where we check the additional condition of the modified Kruskals
algorithm, are based around this int[] of data values pertaining to each tree. 

P4C runs fairly quickly. For all of the test files given it segments each in under a minute. Included in the submission
is an images folder with the test images and the results after running them through P4C. Below we state what k values we
found to work well and a description of the results. 

We found that while segmenter() could come up with 1000s of segments at low k values, a few of them were true segments 
and others were largely empty. However, if we made k values exceedingly large (on the order of millions) 
we could shrink the number of segments but we would still get dozens of segments with almost nothing in them 
and one segment with the image. To resolve this we chose to make it that if there are more than 10 segments 
we only save the segments that account for more than 1% of the pixels in the total image. I think on piazza somewhere 
it said use 10% but we found that that was too large of a requirement for segments in a file like Edge.png.

This approach allows us to use low k values where they yield accurate segments while filtering out most of the 
very small, mostly empty segments that are not representative of actual segments in the image. Overall P4C seems to work
fairly well. We are happy to see that it segments most of the test files successfully, with only a few hiccups (see below)

Like another group on Piazza, for some of the images the background is transparent for some reason.

CHECKSTYLE:

All of our code is checkstyle compliant, except for the fact that
Pixel and P4C have magic numbers for bitshifting. However, it was
stated on piazza that magic numbers were permissible on this assignment.

Summary of P4C Results:
|||||||||||||||||||||||

Below is a summary of the test images, at what k value they were segmented, and a description of the results.

JHULogo.png segmented at k = 500000
5 segments saved, good separation of the shield, background, and 3 letters

BlackSquare.png segmented at k = 5
2 Segments saved, the gray outer square and the light-gray/white inner square

Edges.png segmented at k = 1
9 segments saved. We do get good segments of the black background out of the square as well as the top, left, and bottom edges. 
However, the inner black square and the right red edge get combined. There are a few other segments with not much in them.

Blue.png segmented at k = 1
2 segments saved. blue1.png seems to have the border of the square. blue2.png has the middle of the blue square.

test1.png segmented at k = 1000
10 segments saved. They all capture patches of green or white in the image. It doesn't seem to capture the whole image, 
in particular the red-orange dot did not make it into a saved segment.

test3.png segmented at k = 100
2 segments saved, it takes the grapefruit-red bar on the left of the image and the oval. The rest of the image, where there is 
a gradient, made too many tiny segments that by the saving rules we established did not make the cut.

test4.png segmented at k = 500
4 segments saved, this one worked perfectly. 1 for the white background, 1 for the blue, and 2 for the orange ovals

testIn.png segmented at k = 100
We got the same results from this as we did from test3.png

stripe.png k = 1
3 segments as expected

bwtest.png k = 1
2 segments, for some reason we can't figure we seem to miss putting the black part in its own segment, it gets grouped with 
one of the white stripes. This is suprising since segmenter generally works well otherwise, yet in this one case it fails to 
seperate black and white, the most drastic difference possible. We're left scratching our heads here since it worked on stripe.png.
